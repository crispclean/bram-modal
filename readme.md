# Bram Modal

**BramModal** is a very basic and small vanilla MODAL JS script.

No IE11 support!

## Installation

```sh
npm install bram-modal --dev
```

## Usage

The library relies on Javascript to build the DOM/functionality.

```sh
import BramModal from "./bram-modal";

new BramModal({
    domString: '',
    customClass: false
    footer: false
});
```
